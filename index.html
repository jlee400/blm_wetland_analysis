        <p>
          Wetlands play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting biodiversity, regulating 
hydrological cycles, and improving water quality. In the United States, many of these critical ecosystems 
are managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which oversees over 245 million acres of 
public lands across diverse landscapes (Figure 1). The BLM’s wetland and riparian monitoring programs, 
including the National AIM Riparian and Wetland Indicators Hub, are central to sustaining ecosystem 
health and ensuring that these lands continue to provide essential ecological services.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the condition and distribution of wetlands vary widely depending on geography, climate, and 
land-use pressures. While some states maintain abundant and diverse wetland systems, others face 
degradation due to aridity, water scarcity, or anthropogenic stress. These disparities present a growing 
challenge for federal land managers seeking to allocate conservation resources equitably across regions.

        <p>
         This study aims to analyze BLM-managed wetlands across the western United States to identify areas 
that may require increased conservation attention and funding. Figure 2 presents the total number of 
wetlands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) across eight western states. The results 
reveal strong spatial disparities in wetland abundance: Nevada contains the highest number of 
wetlands (198), followed by California (160) and Alaska (115), while Oregon has the fewest (6). These 
patterns illustrate how geographic and climatic conditions influence wetland distribution, Nevada’s 
dominance, for instance, reflects its extensive Playa wetlands formed in arid basins, whereas Oregon’s 
low count suggests more limited BLM-managed wetland coverage. Taken together, these findings 
highlight the uneven distribution of wetland resources under federal management and suggest that 
conservation strategies should be region-specific, prioritizing both ecological diversity and 
environmental stress factors to enhance the resilience of U.S. wetland ecosystems

      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <p>
          Data from the BLM National AIM Riparian and Wetland Indicators Hub (Bureau of Land Management, 2025) 
          was analyzed to assess the ecological diversity and health of wetlands across the contiguous United States. 
          All processing and visualization—including bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive mapping—were conducted 
          in Python.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shannon entropy (H = −Σ pᵢ ln pᵢ) and its exponential, the Hill number (eᴴ), were used to measure true 
          diversity among wetland types. The average C value served as a biological indicator of wetland integrity, 
          where higher values represent less-disturbed ecosystems.
        </p>

        <p>
          By combining these metrics with data visualization, this study identifies regional disparities in wetland 
          conditions and supports data-driven conservation planning across BLM-managed landscapes.

        Together, Figure 3 and 4 demonstrate that wetland geomorphology—and thus ecological function—differs 
        significantly across regions. As a result, management and restoration strategies must be tailored to the 
        hydrological regime and landscape characteristics of each state or wetland type.

        Figure 5 illustrates how vegetation composition varies across BLM-managed states. Oregon and Utah 
        show notably higher proportions of non-native vegetation, suggesting stronger ecological disturbance 
        and reduced habitat stability. In contrast, states such as Alaska and Wyoming are dominated by native 
        vegetation, indicating more intact wetland ecosystems with lower levels of biological disruption.

      <p>
        Figure 6 shows a strong positive relationship between Hill’s N1 (species diversity) and the average 
        C value (ecological integrity). Wetlands with higher species diversity tend to exhibit healthier ecological 
        conditions, while degraded, low-diversity systems cluster in states such as Nevada, Idaho, and Utah, 
        where arid environments and land-use pressures are more intense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, Figure 5 and 6 demonstrate that declines in biodiversity and increases in non-native vegetation 
        frequently occur in the same regions. These patterns highlight the importance of targeted restoration efforts 
        and adaptive vegetation management to maintain ecological resilience across western U.S. wetlands.

        Figure 7 illustrates spatial patterns of wetland condition across BLM-managed sites using an interactive 
        map. Each point represents a monitored wetland, with circle size proportional to Hill’s N1 (species 
        diversity) and color indicating the average C value as an index of ecological integrity. Clusters of 
        low-diversity, low-integrity wetlands emerge in southern Nevada and central Idaho, while healthier 
        systems with higher diversity and C values are more common in Alaska and Wyoming. This pattern 
        highlights strong regional contrasts in ecological condition across the BLM portfolio.

      <p>
        Figure 8 focuses on low-quality wetlands, defined as sites with Hill’s N1 ≤ 8.0 and C value ≤ 3.0. The map 
        shows that these degraded systems are most heavily concentrated in Nevada, followed by Idaho and 
        California, where arid conditions and intensive land-use pressures limit native vegetation and reduce 
        biodiversity. In contrast, relatively few low-quality sites appear in Alaska and Wyoming, reinforcing the 
        idea that cooler and less disturbed regions retain more resilient wetland ecosystems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, Figures 7 and 8 emphasize pronounced regional disparities in wetland condition and demonstrate 
        how combining diversity metrics with spatial visualization can support targeted restoration planning and 
        adaptive management across BLM-managed landscapes.

        This is the last section. In this part, we bring together all the ideas explored throughout the project, reflecting on what was learned, what worked well, and what challenges emerged. We revisit the core objectives, summarizing how each was addressed, and highlight the most significant insights that have arisen from the work. Moreover, we outline how the outcomes contribute to the broader field, what implications they may have for future research or real-world applications, and why these findings matter. In addition, this section proposes concrete next steps: further experiments, methods refinement, validation on new datasets, collaborative extensions, or deployment scenarios. We also discuss potential limitations, acknowledge open questions, and suggest areas that merit deeper investigation.
